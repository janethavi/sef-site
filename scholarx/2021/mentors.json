    "bio": "Hasini Jayatilaka is currently a consultant in the scientific and medical affairs group at Syneos Health where she works with mid-size, and large pharmaceutical organizations to develop data driven product-specific medical affairs strategy. She is also a strategic advisor for AtlasXomics, a startup company recently formed to bring to market a novel the spatial transcriptomics and proteomics technology. Hasini also serves as an investment fellow for Life Sciences Angels which is a premier angel investment group focused solely on healthcare investing, including medical devices, diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and digital health.Prior to Syneos Health, AtlasXomics and Life Science Angels, Hasini was a post-doctoral scientist at Stanford University and studied mechanisms of relapse and metastasis using novel technologies such as mass cytometry (CyTOF) and Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) to conduct multiparameter protein analysis. Considering that current cancer treatments ultimately fail owing to metastasis and relapse, her work uncovered new insights that will help in the development of immunotherapies by providing future avenues for therapeutic design. Hasini received her PhD from Johns Hopkins University in Chemical and Biomolecular engineering where she discovered a novel synergistic signaling pathway between interleukin 6 and 8 that is responsible for regulating metastasis. Inhibition of this pathway decreases the metastatic burden of cancer cells. Testing in pre-clinical models has demonstrated that inhibition of this synergistic cell density-dependent signaling mechanism significantly reduces effective metastasis to the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes without accelerating tumor growth. The results of Hasini's study established a novel method of solely targeting metastasis which is responsible for 90% of cancer related deaths and laid the foundation for the development of combination therapies that effectively target tumor growth and metastasis, and the establishment of bi-specific antibodies to target the synergistic signaling mechanism. Hasini was named a Forbes 30 under 30 in Science in 2018 for her contributions to cancer metastasis.",
